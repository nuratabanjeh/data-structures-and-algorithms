# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks

the stack is a data structure that consists of (Nodes)


### FILO & LIFO:

FILO means that the first added into the stack is the last out and LIFO is the opposite of FILO

## Queue:

Like stack, queue is a linear data structure that stores items in FIFO & LILO the first in first out and lilo is the opposite.

## Approach & Efficiency

#### stack

push : 
time : O(1) 
space : O(1)

pop : 
time : O(1) 
space : O(1)

peek :
 time : O(1) 
 space : O(1)

isEmpty : 
time : O(1) 
space : O(1)

#### queue

enqueue : 
time : O(1) 
space : O(1)

dequeue : 
time : O(1) 
space : O(1)

peek : 
time : O(1) 
space : O(1)

isEmpty : 
time : O(1) 
space : O(1)


## API

4. isEmpty (true when stack is empty)

1. Enqueue (add)

2. Dequeue (remove)
